package Graph;

/* Graphs can be represented with a set of vertices and edges
 * Graphs can be directed or undirected, and can contain self loops and multiedges.
 * The maximum number of edges in a simple directed graph is n(n-1) where n = |# of Vertices|
 * The maximum of edges in a simple undirected graph is (n/2)(n-1)
